## THE SHIFT

**From:** Individual 1-on-1 training ($150-300)
**To:** Organizational consulting ($1,500-10,000+)

Same knowledge. Bigger contracts. Recurring revenue.

---

## THE PROBLEM (For Organizations)

**Schools:**
- Teachers don't know how to use AI
- Students are already using it (cheating concerns)
- No curriculum for AI literacy
- Administrators worried about policy

**Workplaces:**
- Employees using AI unsanctioned (security risk)
- No AI policy or training
- Fear of job replacement
- Missing productivity gains

**The Gap:** Organizations know AI is important but don't know how to implement it responsibly.
