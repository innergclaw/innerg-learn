# InnerG Learn — AI Education Consultation

> **Positioning:** "Most AI courses teach you what AI *is*. I teach you how to actually *use* it."

---

## The Problem

People have access to:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
- OpenClaw, n8n, Zapier
- APIs, local models, agents

But they don't know:
- How to set any of it up
- How to connect tools together
- How to build something that actually works for THEIR situation
- How to make AI remember context, build skills, automate workflows

**Gap:** Everyone's selling tools. Nobody's teaching implementation.

## Outreach

**Cold DM script:**
> "Saw you asking about AI agents. I teach 1-on-1 sessions on how to actually set them up — not theory, just working systems. First 30 min free if you want to see if it's a fit."

**Email to list:**
> "Most people have AI tools but don't know how to use them. I'm opening 5 spots for 1-on-1 AI training this month. Here's what we'll build together..."

---

## Pricing Psychology

- $150 = impulse buy for professionals
- $300 = investment for serious learners
- Both priced lower than "AI bootcamps" ($500-2000)
- Higher perceived value because it's 1-on-1
